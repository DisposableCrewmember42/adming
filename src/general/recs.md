# General Recommendations

## Make use of cameras!
You can open a floating window which follows a player of your choice around using the ``camera <username>`` command or by right-clicking a player and clicking *Admin > Open Camera*.

They are great for observing multiple people at the same time. I often open cameras on first joins to keep track of what they're up to while doing other stuff.

## Keep the Player list open
The Players tab of the F7 Menu is probably the most useful one of them all.

The player records displayed in the table can be right-clicked to display the same options you would get by right-clicking their character in-game.

## Open the Admin Chat in a separate window
The different Admin chat channels provide you with important information about the round. You can use the ``achatwindow`` command to open the chat in a separate floating window. This way, alerts and admin messages won't get buried in comms traffic.

## The Console is your friend
You can often get information and perform actions quicker by using Console commands rather than clicking around in the GUI.

For example, ``tpto <username / entity id>`` and ``warp <warp point>`` allow you to get to where you want to much quicker than using the Ghost Warp menu.

Some essential round info, such as antag objectives, isn't exposed through the GUI at all.
