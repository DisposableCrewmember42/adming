# Toolshed Commands

## General Information
Toolshed commands are invoked as part of their own custom query language. Toolshed allows you to search for certain groups of entities and then apply operations to them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you want to use Toolshed, always make sure to start your command by with ``> ``.

### Selecting entities
You can iterate over certain (groups of) entities with the following commands:

#### self
- This selects the entity you're controlling, primarily useful for modifying your aGhost
- For example, you can make yourself able to see health bars using ``> self comp:ensure ShowHealthBars``

#### marked
- You can store an entity to be selected using this command by right-clicking it and then selecting *Admin > Mark entity*

#### entities
> [!WARNING]
> When using the entities command, always make sure you know what you are doing. Double-check your commands.
> Accidentally applying actions to a large amount of entities could easily end the round or crash the server.
- This allows you to query all entities known to the server.
- You should specify a filter for your query using...
    - ``with`` to search for entities that hold a certain Component.
        - For example, you can select all silicons using ``> entities with SiliconLawBound``
    - ``prototyped`` to search for entities based on a certain prototype
        - For example, you can delete all puddles using ``> entities prototyped Puddle delete ``

#### ent
- Use ``> ent <ID>`` to select a specific entity based on its numeric ID.


## Query Recipes

### Reopen a specific job slot
```
> stations:get | jobs:job StationAi | jobs:set 1
```
- The job prototypes will autocomplete while typing, just replace StationAi if you want to open another job.
- You can also adjust the value using ``jobs:adjust n``, where n can be a positive or negative value.
- When reopening Station AI specifically, you should download the old AI using an intellicard before executing this command. If a player joins while the old AI is still attached to the core, they will spawn as an invisible entity that is unable to move.

### List all Silicons and their laws
```
> entities with SiliconLawBound tee { emplace { var $name ??; ent $value laws:get ?? } }
```
- the tee here is necessary to ignore the laws:get output and stop the console from being spammed.
- this is certainly not what Toolshed was made for, hence the nested tee and emplace and the debug prints. Don't look at this as an example of a sane command.
