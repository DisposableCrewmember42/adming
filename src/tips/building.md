## Placing entities/tiles in a rectangular shape
![](../images/building_clickndrag.png)
- To easily place many tiles or entities at the same time, select what you want to place and **hold CTRL** while clicking on the first corner. Then **release CTRL** and move your mouse to select the second corner. Click the second corner without holding CTRL.
  - This only works when placing tiles/entities aligned to the grid. If you want to place a bunch of entities that are normally placed freely, select SnapgridCenter or SnapgridBorder in the dropdown menu of the spawn panel.
